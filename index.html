    <h1>Grammar Notation</h1>
    <div id="selfdocumenting">In his book <i>Mindstorms</i>, Seymour Papert encourages us to find and create tools that make abstract ideas more concrete. Below is a simple <i>grammar notation system</i>. Each part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) is given a specific colour. Type or paste whatever you want in the text box and click the button to generate the notation.
    </div>
    <p>This was made for <a href="diversity.p5js.org">diversity p5.js</a> Mindstorms book club, and uses p5.js and rita.js.

    <p contenteditable id="input">"While still working in Geneva I had become sensitive to the way in which materials from the then very young computer cultures were allowing psychologists to develop new ways to think about thinking. In fact, my entry into the world of computers was motivated largely by the idea that children could also benefit, perhaps even more than the psychologists, from the way in which computer models seemed able to give concrete form to areas of knowledge that had previously appeared so intangible and abstract." - Seymour Papert</p>
