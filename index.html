        <h1>Grammar Notation</h1>
        <div id="selfdocumenting">In his book <i>Mindstorms</i>, Seymour Papert encourages us to find and create tools that make abstract ideas more concrete. Below is a simple <i>grammar notation system</i>. Each part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) is given a specific colour. Type or paste whatever you want in the text box and click the button to generate the notation.

        <p>This was made for <a href="diversity.p5js.org">diversity p5.js</a> Mindstorms book club, and uses p5.js and rita.js.

        <p contenteditable id="input">"While still working in Geneva I had become sensitive to the way in which materials from the then very young computer cultures were allowing psychologists to develop new ways to think about thinking. In fact, my entry into the world of computers was motivated largely by the idea that children could also benefit, perhaps even more than the psychologists, from the way in which computer models seemed able to give concrete form to areas of knowledge that had previously appeared so intangible and abstract.
            <br>
            <br>I began to see how children who had learned to program computers could use very concrete computer models to think about thinking and to learn about learning and in doing so, enhance their powers as psychologists and as epistemologists. For example, many children are held back in their learning because they have a model of learning in which you have either "got it" or "got it wrong." But when you learn to program a computer you almost never get it right the first time. Learning to be a master programmer is learning to become highly skilled at isolating and correcting "bugs," the parts that keep the program from working. The question to ask about the program is not whether it is right or wrong but if it is fixable. If this way of looking at intellectual products were generalized to how the larger culture thinks about knowledge and its acquisition, we all might be less intimidated by our fears of "being wrong." This potential influence of the computer on changing our notion of a black and white version of our successes and failures is an example of using the computer as an "object-to-think-with." It is obviously not necessary to work with computers in order to acquire good strategies for learning. Surely "debugging" strategies were developed by successful learners long before computers existed. But thinking about learning by analogy with developing a program is a powerful and accessible way to get started on becoming more articulate about one's debugging strategies and more deliberate about improving them." - Seymour Papert</p>
