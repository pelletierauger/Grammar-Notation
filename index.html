        <h1>Grammar Notation</h1>
        <div id="selfdocumenting">In his book <i>Mindstorms</i>, Seymour Papert encourages us to find and create tools that make abstract ideas more concrete. Below is a simple <i>grammar notation system</i>. Each part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) is given a specific colour. Type or paste whatever you want (in English) in the text box and click the button to generate new notation.

        <p>This was made for the <a href="diversity.p5js.org">diversity.p5.js</a> Mindstorms book club, using p5.js and rita.js.

            <br />
            <br> So we know this place,
            <br /> for we have glanced more times than we'd like to share
            <br /> into eyes that stare with nothing there
            <br /> behind them but an unfulfilled wish
            <br /> and an unconscious yearning for life
            <br /> though death rests comfortably beside us.
            <br /> At night their moans are louder.
            <br /> They come to visit the guards at the gate,
            <br /> and they stay until morning
            <br /> torturing their guilt-ridden insides.
            <br /> The silent cries of the keepers are louder
            <br /> than the booms that come from the guns
            <br /> they use to occupy the space.
            <br />
            <br /> And we know this place,
            <br /> for we have seen more times than we'd like to imagine
            <br /> bloated cadavers floating through waters of a city gone savage,
            <br /> foraging the land for what can be salvaged.
            <br /> But what can be saved when all is lost?
            <br /> It happened in August, twenty-nine days in.
            <br /> We are now five days out of the only place
            <br /> we knew to call house and home.
            <br /> Few things are certain:
            <br /> one, we have no food;
            <br /> two, there are more bodies lying at the roadside
            <br /> than hot plates being distributed
            <br /> or first aid being administered
            <br /> or recognition as a citizen.
            <br /> Fourteenth Amendment, X, refugee, check.
            <br />
            <br /> And we know this place.
            <br /> It's ever-changing yet forever the same:
            <br /> Money and power and greed, the game.
            <br /> They suck and devour the souls of the slain.
            <br /> What a feast for the beast at their table of shame
            <br /> with napkins around necks that catch the blood that drains
            <br /> from the flesh they chew, it's hailed again.
            <br />
            <br /> And we know this place, all too well,
            <br /> dank with the smell of death and doom.
            <br /> It hovers, it smothers, no growth, no room,
            <br /> no pretty, no please, just grey, just gloom,
            <br /> just burned me of hope, and it died too soon,
            <br /> just juckin', just jiving, just living, we just fools.
            <br />
            <br /> And we know this place.
            <br /> It's decked in all its array and splendor,
            <br /> golden streets with good intentions
            <br /> capture our attention, gadgets and inventions
            <br /> pesticide the food supply, flu-like symptoms,
            <br /> diabetic condition, a cancer in the system,
            <br /> held on hold, it's a pistol to the temple.
            <br /> Go run to the churches, tell reverend it's simple.
            <br /> Good works and good deeds is what equals redemption,
            <br /> but tell me, please, Jesus never mentioned,
            <br /> how do churchmen get extensions on freedom,
            <br /> while children are being fondled
            <br /> from the altar to the streets, then back to the sanctuaries?
            <br /> It's kind of scary, ain't it?
            <br /> to know that both the prophet and the priest practice deceit,
            <br /> then come to the people and claim peace, peace,
            <br /> come to the people and claim love, love.
            <br /> But where is the peace, huh?
            <br /> Where is the love?
            <br /> Where that balm in Gilead
            <br /> that can heal the wounded soul
            <br /> or make the half-man whole?
            <br />
            <br /> I swear, we know this place,
            <br /> because we have vowed before never again to return,
            <br /> but here we are, back in the desert,
            <br /> dry mouth and thirsting for waters from Heaven.
            <br /> But come, come, children, rally around,
            <br /> and maybe together we can make a sound
            <br /> that will shake the trees or rattle the ground,
            <br /> make strong our knees,
            <br /> we's freedom bound.
            <br />
            <br /> And we know this place.
            <br /> Reclaim the crown.
            <br /> Hold onto the prize,
            <br /> never put it down.
            <br /> Be firm in the stance,
            <br /> no break, no bow,
            <br /> got to forward on, Mama,
            <br /> make your move now.
            <br /> Forward on, Papa,
            <br /> make your move now.
            <br /> Forward, dear children,
            <br /> 'cuz freedom is now.
